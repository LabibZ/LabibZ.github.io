Hi, I'm Labib.

I'm a software developer based in Toronto, Canada. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Math and Computer Science at the University of Toronto.

Outside of work, I am a nerd for muay thai and enjoy taking photos of stone buildings and photos of people so terrible that they would rather I don't. Take a look [here](/projects/f1-photography).
