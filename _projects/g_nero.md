A 3D Shooter Platformer game.
![nero](/assets/img/nero.jpg)
My first project with Unity. Simple 3 level platformer with many laser obstacles, giant balls, tricky parkour, and shooting turrets. (But you have a gun so you can shoot back!). As for the art, I aimed to make it look futuristic.

**Tech:** _Unity, C#, Blender_
